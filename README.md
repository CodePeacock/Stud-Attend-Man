# Student Attendance Management

An application built with Flutter modernizing the orthodox process of attendance.(At least that's what I tried to do).

## Getting Started

This project is the starting point of my Flutter career(perhaps).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Flutter - Beautiful native apps in record time](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- [Dart packages: Find and use packages to build Dart and Flutter apps.](https://pub.dev/)
- [Fonts: Google Fonts were implemented](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[Online Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
